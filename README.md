### solving an algorithm a day to stay sharp and making coding fun!

### open the sandbox.html in your browser and open the console.html
### make sure the script in sandbox.html is set to sandbox.js 
### in sandbox.js, copy in the algorithm challenge you wanna try from the Algorithms folder or try a new one from another source! if you solve it, add it as a new js file inside of the Algorthims folder and make sure to comment it out and place it at the bottom of the file like the other ones
