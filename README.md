### Solving an algorithm a day to stay sharp and making coding fun!

# Clone down this repo

## Open the a-sandbox.html in your browser

## Open the console.html

## Make sure the script in a-sandbox.html is set to the js file you wish to run on the console. The most recent script was "sum-of-array.js".

## Choose an algorithm's js file, copy in the algorithm challenge you wanna try from the list of js algorithm files in the root directory, or try a new one from another source! if you solve it, add it as a new js file inside of the Algorthims folder and make sure to comment it out and place it at the bottom of the file like the other ones
